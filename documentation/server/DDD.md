    I'll design a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) structure for TellMe,
    breaking down the different bounded contexts and their relationships.

### `Core Domains:`

1. `Customer Service Core`
   - Aggregate Roots:
     - Conversation
     - Ticket
     - CustomerProfile
   - Entities:
     - Message
     - ThreadHistory
     - SupportAgent
   - Value Objects:
     - TicketStatus
     - Priority
     - ResponseTime
     - CustomerSegment

2. `Integration Hub`
   - Aggregate Roots:
     - Channel
     - PlatformConnection
   - Entities:
     - ChannelConfig
     - Integration
   - Value Objects:
     - ChannelType
     - ConnectionStatus
     - APICredentials

3. `Analytics & Segmentation`
   - Aggregate Roots:
     - CustomerSegment
     - AnalyticsReport
   - Entities:
     - Demographic
     - BehaviorPattern
     - InteractionHistory
   - Value Objects:
     - SegmentCriteria
     - AnalyticsPeriod
     - MetricValue

4. `Enterprise Management`
   - Aggregate Roots:
     - Department
     - Team
     - Organization
   - Entities:
     - Employee
     - Role
     - Permission
   - Value Objects:
     - DepartmentType
     - TeamCapacity
     - ServiceLevel

### `Departments & Their Domains:`

1. `Customer Support Department`
   - Primary Domain: Customer Service Core
   - Responsibilities:
     - Direct customer interaction
     - Ticket management
     - Service quality monitoring

2. `IT/Technical Department`
   - Primary Domain: Integration Hub
   - Responsibilities:
     - Platform integrations
     - System maintenance
     - Technical support
     - API management

3. `Analytics Department`
   - Primary Domain: Analytics & Segmentation
   - Responsibilities:
     - Customer segmentation
     - Performance analytics
     - Trend analysis
     - Reporting

4. `Operations Department`
   - Primary Domain: Enterprise Management
   - Responsibilities:
     - Resource allocation
     - Team management
     - Process optimization

5. `Sales & Marketing Department`
   - Supporting All Domains
   - Responsibilities:
     - Customer acquisition
     - Market analysis
     - Product promotion

### `Bounded Contexts:`

1. `Support Context`
   - Manages active conversations
   - Handles ticket lifecycle
   - Customer interaction history

2. `Integration Context`
   - Channel management
   - Platform synchronization
   - API gateway

3. `Analytics Context`
   - Customer segmentation
   - Performance metrics
   - Reporting engine

4. `Management Context`
   - Team organization
   - Resource allocation
   - Access control

<br/>

### `Context Mappings:`

1. `Support ↔ Integration`
   - Shared Kernel: Message routing
   - Anti-corruption Layer: Channel adapters

2. `Support ↔ Analytics`
   - Partnership: Customer data sharing
   - Conformist: Segmentation rules

3. `Management ↔ Support`
   - Customer/Supplier: Resource allocation
   - Open Host Service: Team availability
